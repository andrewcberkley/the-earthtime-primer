# Wider Dissemination {#wider-dissemination}

EarthTime stories are meant to be shared. In an ideal world, your audience would be able to attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos and experience EarthTime in the Global Situation on a massive screen while a world-renowned expert guides them around the globe explaining the different waypoints; however, we recognize that most of the time, your audience will be consuming EarthTime stories on a computer screen or mobile device. This section will cover things that you should take into consideration from a technical point of view when sharing your EarthTime stories with the world using simpler formats.

## Best Practices for Embedding

### Embedding Using Javascript {-}

A javascript-based inline scrolling EarthTime story can be placed in the middle of other content, with some content above the first frame of the scrolling story, and some content below the last frame of the scrolling story.  This is a common approach when combining map visuals within longer prose or other media. The following code uses HTML and a few lines of javascript to load the EarthTime library, select the story, and identify the correct div to populate.

```{html}
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1">
      <title>EarthTime Mobile Story Example</title>
      <style type="text/css">
      body {
        margin: 0;
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }

      .non_story_content {
        margin: 8px;
      }
      </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="non_story_content">
       <h1>Embedded Story</h1>
       This is placeholder text used before the story. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
    </div>
    <div id="story_container1"></div>
    This is placeholder text that comes after the story. Proin quis lacus nec felis fringilla hendrerit.
    <div class="non_story_content">
      This placeholder text between the stories. Nullam maximus dignissim. Nam in.
  </div>
  </body>
  <script src="https://earthtime.org/m/stories/mobile-embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script>
    // Additional parameters include:
    // earthtimeSpreadsheet
    // showEarthtimeAbout
    // disableAutoFullscreen
    // mediaFitStyle
    var settings = {
      "earthtimeSpreadsheet" : "https://earthtime.org/explore#waypoints=1Ua4MpiPs2A79p9SdFRBiXmiOcMVG6Oze6tMU_ReEs8k.0" 
      // Where '.0' represents the "tab Id" of the spreadsheet. Up until this point, we've been dealing with "sheetId"; 
      // however, for this to render correctly, you need to know which order the sheets in the spreadsheet are in; 
      // therefore, a "tab Id" of '.0' represents the first sheetId, a tab Id of '.1' represents the second SheetId, 
      // '.2' represents the third, etc.
    }

    // Register the stories. Include more registerStory calls (with different story names from the spreadsheet) to 
    // add multiple stories to this page.
    // First parameter is the name of the story, obtained from the 'Waypoint Title' column of the waypoint spreadsheet. 
    // It is case insensitive and the leading '##' characters must be removed.
    // Second parameter is the id of the HTML element (usually a div) that you want to insert the story into.
    earthtime.registerStory('Deforestation', 'story_container1');

    // Embed the stories.
    // Call this with no args to use the default settings or pass in a settings hash, like the one defined above.
    earthtime.embedStories(settings);
  </script>
</html>
```

Note that we introduce four additional parameters in the HTML example above that can be passed in when embedding an EarthTime story using javascript: `earthtimeSpreadsheet`, `showEarthtimeAbout`, `disableAutoFullscreen`, and `mediaFitStyle`.

#### `earthtimeSpreadsheet` {-}

This parameter will default to the standard `Default EarthTime Waypoints, Dotmap layers, and Bubble Layers` found at `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rCiksJv4aXi1usI0_9zdl4v5vuOfiHgMRidiDPt1WfE/edit#gid=1596808134`; however, a different one can be passed in if necessary.

#### `showEarthtimeAbout` {-}

This parameter defaults to `FALSE`. If the parameter is set to `TRUE`, then an “About Section” will appear as the last waypoint in the story briefly describing EarthTime.

#### `disableAutoFullscreen` {-}

This parameter can be `TRUE`or `FALSE` with the default being set to `FALSE`. If the parameter is set to `TRUE`, the story content will only fill the width of the area the `HTML div`. Otherwise, if set to false, the story content will fill the entire screen when scrolled into view.

#### `mediaFitStyle` {-}

This parameter can be set to either `COVER` or `CONTAIN` with the default being set to `COVER`. If the parameter is set to `COVER` the content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio, whilst filling the entire content area—that is, the content will be clipped to fit; however, if the parameter is set to `CONTAIN`, the content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio, while fitting within the element's content box, which could mean that letterboxing occurs.

### Embedding using iFrames {-}

An iframe-based EarthTime scrolling story is somewhat similar to the javascript fixed-position scrolling story but uses an iframe instead of javascript. This is useful if you are embedding in a CMS type environment where loading or running external javascript is limited or not allowed. For example, you could invoke an iFrame as follows:

`<iframe src="https://earthtime.org/m/stories/Deforestation#waypoints=1Ua4MpiPs2A79p9SdFRBiXmiOcMVG6Oze6tMU_ReEs8k.0" width="900px" height="600px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`

Note that an individual EarthTime story is what is used as the source for iFrames, not individual waypoints.  Also please keep in mind that on a mobile device, the iFrame will be nearly identical to the interactive iframe example below, except here the `src` is slightly different placing an `/m/` before sotries and no extra parameters passed in after the `#` following the story title. Using the `/m/` as seen in this example also forces a scrolling based EarthTime story on a user, regardless of whether they visit on a computer or mobile device.

## Best Practices for Utilizing GIFs

There are a few scenarios where you might want to consider recording a GIF of a specific waypoint or series of waypoints instead of using the traditional embedding methods detailed above. The most practical scenario is when you’re expecting to share your EarthTime story via social media.

There’s a number of methods for creating GIFs, but we recommend using screen capture software to take a video of the waypoint(s) you’d like to use for your GIF(s). Start the recording when the waypoint starts and let the waypoint run through at least two visualizations cycles—this will allow you to edit the start and end points in a way that is more seamless rather than trying to time it exactly^[We recommend capturing this video while in the mobile EarthTime story view rather than the Explore view because the red portion of the timeline at the bottom will reset once the visualization has run its course and we’ve found in our own experience that the aspect ratio as well as the date ticker in the mobile view creates a much more user-friendly experience for social media consumption.].
