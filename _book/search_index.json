Berkley 2021-11-02 Preface This is the online version of EarthTime documentation, a reference tool currently under development and intended for Forum staff, members of the CMU CREATE Lab and extended community, and/or anyone else that has an interest in creating and sharing narratives that examine complex global topics through data visualization instead of traditional prose using this unique storytelling tool. Ive been fortunate enough to play a small role collaborating with the CREATE Lab on EarthTime since 2018 from the World Economic Forums side and with my pending departure from the Forum, the ultimate aim of this work is to not only formally archive the information that is stuck in my head into a form that is more widely accessible, but I also hope this document is able to convey the excitement and joy that Ive been lucky enough to experience whilst a collaborator on this project. It is my hope that others can find the same excitement and joy in using data to help communities across the globeeither in Davos, Pittsburgh, or somewhere in betweenexamine major environmental, social, and political phenomenon across time, across space, and between each other. - Andrew C. Berkley, 2021 0.1 Premise Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 0.2 Documentation Structure This document opens with a brief history of the EarthTime project. This section starts with the history of the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University where EarthTime was first conceived and goes onto detail EarthTimes journey from the original time-lapse project proposed as a collaboration between Googles Earth Engine team, Carnegie Mellon Universitys CREATE Lab, and TIME Magazine all the way to its presence as the Global Situation Space at the World Economic Forums Annual Meetings in Davos, Switzerland, as well as its continued use on the Forums Strategic Intelligence platform. The next section of this document goes onto discuss the basics of EarthTime in what is referred to as the Explore view that one would find when visiting the main EarthTime website. It also suggests a few prerequisites for computer hardware that one is expected to have to successful run EarthTime in a browser. The third section of this documents focuses on generating ideas for EarthTime storiesand by extension generating ideas for the data layers that underpin them. This section is generally focused on communication with and outreach to three major groups: academic experts, industry leaders, and journalists. While not technical in nature, per se, the fourth section of the document explores the philosophy around data gathering process with a special emphasis placed on open-source data web scraping. It is predicated on the assumption that one of the three aforementioned groups has pointed you towards a data that is either messy or otherwise doesnt exist in a computer-readable format. It briefly touches on data analysis, but that subject is beyond the scope of this document. The documents fifth section examines a number of philosophies around data visualization in the EarthTime specific context. It provides a brief introduction to the different types of data layers, color theory, as well as geopolitical considerations that should be taken into account when attempting to visualize names and borders in regions with disputed territories. The sixth section of the document is also the shortest section and provides a few lines on the art of data wrangling. It implores readers to data wrangle using a code first, not click first approach so that their process can be reproducible through code. Much of the data wrangling documentation for EarthTime can be found in the companion R package, EarthTimeR. The document seventh section looks at getting formatted data into EarthTime with a process known as data ingestion. This section covers the use of Google sheets to read data into EarthTime. The eighth section covers the EarthTime layers sheets. It covers understanding the structure of waypoints, waypoint URLs, and CSV layers. Within the CSV layers section, the most fields are covered as well as special considerations that should be taken into account when determining how to best use certain fields. Rather than an editing or style guide, the ninth section of the document tries to establish a reasonable workflow when attempting to publish an EarthTime story. It also dives into arguments for an against using EarthTime for conveying certain types of data to a wide variety of audiences and what one should take into account when pushing the limits of storytelling through EarthTime. The tenth section covers dissemination of EarthTime stories. It looks at the advantages of visualizing stories with mobile users in mind, how to embed stories in iFrames, and the use of GIFs (pronounced /f/, not /df/) for highlighting critical waypoints. The final section covers closing thoughts and final remarks on the EarthTime project. It also includes the reference section for those wishing to explore more.

This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files.

There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 1.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
