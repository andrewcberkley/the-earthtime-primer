Berkley November 2021 Preface This is the online version of documentation produced for understanding and using EarthTime as a storytelling platform. This documentation is intended to be a reference tool currently under development and intended for World Economic Forum staff, members of the CMU CREATE Lab and extended community, and/or anyone else that has an interest in creating and sharing narratives that examine complex global topics through data visualization instead of traditional prose using this unique storytelling tool. Ive been fortunate enough to play a small role collaborating with the CREATE Lab on EarthTime since 2018 from the World Economic Forums side and with my pending departure from the Forum, the ultimate aim of this work is to not only formally archive the information that is stuck in my head into a form that is more widely accessible, but I also hope this document is able to convey the excitement and joy that Ive been lucky enough to experience whilst a collaborator on this project. It is my hope that others can find the same excitement and joy in using data to help communities across the globeeither in Davos, Pittsburgh, or somewhere in betweenexamine major environmental, social, and political phenomenon across time, across space, and between each other. Premise Both the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and the World Economic Forum recognize that progress happens by bringing together people from all walks of liferanging from government and business, to civil society and academiawho have the drive and the will to make positive change. As our world has become increasingly complex, people are increasingly seeking out ways to make sense of societal shifts at both a local and global level. While people try to make sense of new phenomenon by just using data, data alone struggles to capture and bear witness to the key issues of our time. The EarthTime project is an interface that attempts to create powerful narratives by connecting the dots, using facts, conveying a sense of empathy, and using data all at once. Using large spatial and temporal datasets, the fact-based narratives of created alongside experts within this project have successfully broken through language and culture barriers, forged common ground across diverse viewpoints, and to create the sense of unity needed to have meaningful discourse about how to best chart our future together more meaningfully. The aim of this document is to introduce readers and guide readers as they begin to explore how best to create data narratives for the interactive, web-based version of EarthTime. In doing so, we recognize that some of these stories will be ones of decline, but hopefully as a tool it can be used to demonstrate our collective power to effect change. Documentation Structure This document opens with a brief history of the EarthTime project. This section starts with the history of the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University where EarthTime was first conceived and goes onto detail EarthTimes journey from the original time-lapse project proposed as a collaboration between Googles Earth Engine team, Carnegie Mellon Universitys CREATE Lab, and TIME Magazine all the way to its presence as the Global Situation Space at the World Economic Forums Annual Meetings in Davos, Switzerland, as well as its continued use on the Forums Strategic Intelligence platform. The next section of this document goes onto discuss the basics of EarthTime in what is referred to as the Explore view that one would find when visiting the main EarthTime website. It also suggests a few prerequisites for computer hardware that one is expected to have to successful run EarthTime in a browser. The third section of this documents focuses on generating ideas for EarthTime storiesand by extension generating ideas for the data layers that underpin them. This section is generally focused on communication with and outreach to three major groups: academic experts, industry leaders, and journalists. While not technical in nature, per se, the fourth section of the document explores the philosophy around data gathering process with a special emphasis placed on open-source data web scraping. It is predicated on the assumption that one of the three aforementioned groups has pointed you towards a data that is either messy or otherwise doesnt exist in a computer-readable format. It briefly touches on data analysis, but that subject is beyond the scope of this document. The documents fifth section examines a number of philosophies around data visualization in the EarthTime specific context. It provides a brief introduction to the different types of data layers, color theory, as well as geopolitical considerations that should be taken into account when attempting to visualize names and borders in regions with disputed territories. The sixth section of the document is also the shortest section and provides a few lines on the art of data wrangling. It implores readers to data wrangle using a code first, not click first approach so that their process can be reproducible through code. Much of the data wrangling documentation for EarthTime can be found in the companion R package, EarthTimeR. The document seventh section looks at getting formatted data into EarthTime with a process known as data ingestion. This section covers the use of Google sheets to read data into EarthTime. The eighth section covers the EarthTime layers sheets. It covers understanding the structure of waypoints, waypoint URLs, and CSV layers. Within the CSV layers section, the most fields are covered as well as special considerations that should be taken into account when determining how to best use certain fields. Rather than an editing or style guide, the ninth section of the document tries to establish a reasonable workflow when attempting to publish an EarthTime story. It also dives into arguments for an against using EarthTime for conveying certain types of data to a wide variety of audiences and what one should take into account when pushing the limits of storytelling through EarthTime. The tenth section covers dissemination of EarthTime stories. It looks at the advantages of visualizing stories with mobile users in mind, how to embed stories in iFrames, and the use of GIFs (pronounced /f/, not /df/) for highlighting critical waypoints. The final section covers closing thoughts and final remarks on the EarthTime project. It also includes the reference section for those wishing to explore more. Acknowledgements First and foremost, it has been a pleasure collaborating with Illah Nourbakhsh and the wider CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. Since our first contact, Ive resonated with your vision to promote data literacy, inspire meaningful dialogue, and democratize access to data for everyone in an inclusive and transparent way. A very special thanks is reserved to those I worked most closely with on EarthTime, especially Paul Dille, Ryan Hoffman, Jared Kohler, Gabriel ODonnell, Randy Sargent, and Anne Wright who helped create the platform that helps us look at in the mirror at the results of our past decisions in the hopes that as a society we can make more informed, forward-facing choices. To everyone at the World Economic Forum who was instrumental in establishing and shepherding the relationship with the CREATE Lab at different points in time for various programming purposes at the Global Situation Space at Forum events especially Gill Cassar, Taylor Clayton, Teresa Hartmann, Dara Lee, Damien Micheli, and Stéphanie Nassenstein. My opportunities with EarthTime wouldnt have been possible without the backing and support of the Forums Strategic Intelligence team (formerly Knowledge Networks &amp; Analysis), especially Stephan Mergenthaler and Jim Landale, as well as the broader support of the teams Managing Director at the time, Jeremy Jurgens, and of course and big thank you to the wider network of experts from the Forums Global Future Councils and Expert Network that I had the pleasure of working with over the years. Finally, Im eternally grateful to my main partner in crime, editor, and dear friend, John Letzing. Your love of words and storytelling as well as your keen eye for details allowed us to publish nearly 100 original EarthTime stories together. For better or for worse, we were determined to bear witness to some of the far-flung tragedies of the world using EarthTime and the data at our disposal and it is my hope that the couple million of people that consumed our stories will have the courage and imagination to use whatever tools they have at their disposal to deliver positive change. Please forgive me for any errorsgrammatical or otherwisepresent within this document. All errors in this document are my own and Ive decided to leave the making of this document error-free as an exercise for the reader.

As humans weve been drawing our whereabouts on cave walls since the dawn of our species, but weve come a long way in the last couple hundred years. Theres an amazing diversity of the kinds of maps that were seeing today. There are thousands of satellites that are circling our planet taking a pulse of our planet. 1.1 CMU CREATE LAB EarthTime evolved from CREATE Lab projects for creating and exploring panoramic imagery, eventually incorporating data sets from such sources 1.2 GigaPan &amp; GigaPan Time Machine In 2010, the CREATE Lab in collaboration with NASA, developed a technology known as GigaPan which captured a mosaic of hundreds or thousands of digital pictures and stitch those frames into a panorama that was able to be explored interactively. In 2011, released what was known as GigaPan Time Machine, a system that enabled viewers to explore gigapixel-scale, high-resolution videos and image sequences by panning or zooming in and out of the images while simultaneously moving back and forth through time. For examples, were able to use the system to focus in on the details of a booth within a panorama of a carnival midway and also reverse time to see how the booth was constructed; watch a group of plants sprout, grow and flower, but also see others get eaten by caterpillars; or view computer simulations of the early universe, watching as gravity works across 600 million light-years to condense matter into filaments and finally into stars that can be seen by zooming in for a close up. Whereas GigaPan was about exploring physical space at high resolutions, GigaPan Time Machine added the critical element of time to allow viewers to explore both simultaneously. Extending GigaPan into the time dimension, image mosaics were repeatedly captured at set intervals, and then stitched across both space and time to create a video in which each frame was hundreds of millionsand sometimes billionsof pixels. 1.3 Earth-Time Lapse In 2013 the CREATE Lab began working on its Explorables Project, a platform designed to help make big datawith billions of data points, dozens of different fields of information, changing over timeeasier to explore, by layering animations over maps with the hope that it would help people make sense of the data by using visual evidence that was more rhetorically compelling that traditional charts or graphs. The Explorables Project also pioneered the use of base maps instead of solely relying on satellite imagery for what would later become EarthTimes alternate basemaps. Early Explorables Project maps opted to leverage the Google Maps API instead with non-satellite data such as statistics on wealth from the World Top Incomes Database. 1.4 Explorables Project In 2017, the CREATE Lab released their first visualization of global refugee flows between 2000 - 2015 using data from UNHCR. By 2018, this visual was turned into a series of EarthTime stories for the years World Refugee Day: Global Refugee Crisis: The Big Picture co-authored with UNHCR and Global Refugee Crisis: A System Overburdened co-authored by Dr. Khalid Koser of GCERF. By late 2017, the Pittsburgh International Airport had installed an EarthTime display in Concourse D as part of its Creating a Sense of Place program. Still standing to this day, the display gives travelers a chance to interact with the CREATE Labs technology and see how research conducted at Carnegie Mellon University is shaping the future of the world. 1.5 World Economic Forum Partnership 1.6 Satellites Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. "],["the-basics.html", "Section 2 The Basics 2.1 Hardware Prerequisites 2.2 Introduction to the EarthTime Platform", " Section 2 The Basics Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur. 2.1 Hardware Prerequisites A number of individuals have been introduced to EarthTime at the World Economic Forum Annual Meetings Global Situation Spacea 7.2-meter x 2.88-meter (24 feet x 9 feet), multi-screen video hyperwall running off of custom-built computers and might be under the impression that their own computers are not powerful enough to run the platform, thankfully nothing could be further from the truth. The CREATE Lab has pre-processed massive data sets using various techniques to create animated, high-resolution EarthTime visualizations at different time scales. Relying on many of the same strategies used by video game designers, EarthTime uses your computers GPU in to create a new capability for interactively exploring extreme-sized data. While the latest computer models would be ideal, weve found that at a minimum, people wishing to have a smooth experience with EarthTime running from their browser should have a Macbook Pro or Windows laptop from at least 2016 with an Intel i7 CPU. Also try to ensure that the screen resolution is at a minimum 1920x1080 (not 1366x768) and the computers graphics are either at minimum Intel 630 series or dual graphics setup that includes NVIDIA/ATI cards. Many people wonder if EarthTime is compatible with mobile devices. In short, the answer is yes; however, as well briefly touch upon in the next section, only EarthTime stories are currently available on mobile devices (well be be diving deeper into the mobile view in Section 8 focused on Understanding the EarthTime Layers Sheet). Users wishing to have a more interactive experience and explore various data layers should access EarthTime via a browser on a standard desktop or laptop computer. 2.2 Introduction to the EarthTime Platform The way that most people will interface with the EarthTime platform is what is referred to as the Explore view. This is the primary interactive, web-based system that allows users to easily traverse the large spatial and temporal datasets within EarthTime, especially flow maps, dot maps, color images, and satellite base layer renderings. Within Explore, theres a number of headings that youll find useful: Stories, Data Library, Share, Story Editor, and Settings. Stories Its best to think of Stories as data narratives that are organized by various themes. Generally speaking, each one of these narratives has been authored with at least one expert in the relevant area and that expert has carefully chosen not only the relevant dataset and the location on Earth where youll view the dataset, but also a short text to accompany what the viewer will be seeing. The data, the view, and the text are the three components of what is referred to as a waypoint. Well be covering waypoints further in Section 8 on EarthTime layers sheets. Data Layers For examining the total depth and breadth of data that EarthTime has to offer, the Data Layers section offers the best birds eye view. The data in this section is organized alphabetically and clicking on a given category will provide a drop-down list of individual data layers under the respective category. While most data layers will act as an overlay and a user can have multiple data layers present at a given time1, there is a special type of data layer called a base layer, of which only one can be present at a given time. The default base layer is Landsat Annual, which is a massive archive of NASAs Landsat corpus that was covered in Section 1 under Satellites; however, there are a number of other basemaps that can be used depending on your purpose. We cover these basemaps and use cases in greater depth in Section 5 on Data Visualizations &amp; Map Types. Share The Share section creates an opportunity to share the current Explore View as a link with a unique URL, as a still image, or as a video. While this section is useful for novice users looking to share outputs quickly, it is our hope that by the end of this document, users will be comfortable interacting with some of the nuances of EarthTime and will not need to use this section. Well be covering the details of EarthTime URLs in Section 8 on EarthTime layers sheets and best practices in sharing views in Section 10 on Wider Dissemination. Story Editor Similar to the Share section, the Story Editor section gives novice users the opportunity to create stories directly from the Explore View. Once again, by the end of this documents, users should be able to forgo the use of the Story Editor and create and edit stories directly in their respective EarthTime layers sheet, which well be coving in more depth in Section 5 on Data Visualizations &amp; Map Types. Settings The Settings section allows users to import their own EarthTime stories and data layers using a properly formatted Google Sheet. Generally speaking, if one is creating a large number of EarthTime stories and data layers and has a close relationship with the CREATE Lab, then a new EarthTime instance will be created for a specific person, organization, or purpose. This section is intended for users who do not have their own EarthTime instance, but still want to visualize their own EarthTime stories and data layers. We do wamt to caution users against having too many data layers present at once as this may unintentionally create misleading spurious correlations "],["ideation-phase.html", "Section 3 Ideation Phase 3.1 Experts  Forum Expert Network &amp; Academic Peer Review 3.2 Industry and Proprietary Data 3.3 Journalists and Primary Data Collection", " Section 3 Ideation Phase Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Pellentesque fermentum. 6.1 Code first, not click first This section is purely about advocating for users to create data layers, perform analyses, and generate insight using a reproducible and auditable processes. That is, we encourage readers of this document to establish a habit of generating an output through code instead of generating an output using a click-first process using a spreadsheets program2. If you analyze data and provide the underlying data layer to a friend or colleague, they should be able to re-run the analysis from start to finish and get the same result you did (reproducibility). They should also be able to see and understand all the steps in the analysis, as well as the history of how the analysis developed (auditability). Creating reproducible and auditable analyses allows both yourself and others to easily double-check and validate your work. 6.2 EarthTimeR Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Excel doesnt save any of the workflow states involved in building such file.
