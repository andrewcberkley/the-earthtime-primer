# About the book
This is the online version of documentation produced for understanding and using EarthTime as a storytelling platform. This documentation is intended to be a reference tool currently under development and intended for World Economic Forum staff, members of the CMU CREATE Lab and extended community, and/or anyone else that has an interest in creating and sharing narratives that examine complex global topics through data visualization instead of traditional prose using this unique storytelling tool. I’ve been fortunate enough to play a small role collaborating with the CREATE Lab on EarthTime since 2018 from the World Economic Forum’s side and with my pending departure from the Forum, the ultimate aim of this work is to not only formally archive the information that is stuck in my head into a form that is more widely accessible, but I also hope this document is able to convey the excitement and joy that I’ve been lucky enough to experience whilst a collaborator on this project. It is my hope that others can find the same excitement and joy in using data to help communities across the globe—either in Davos, Pittsburgh, or somewhere in between—examine major environmental, social, and political phenomenon across time, across space, and between each other.
