# Preface {-}

This is the online version of documentation produced for understanding and using EarthTime as a storytelling platform. This documentation is intended to be a reference tool currently under development and intended for World Economic Forum staff, members of the CMU CREATE Lab and extended community, and/or anyone else that has an interest in creating and sharing narratives that examine complex global topics through data visualization instead of traditional prose using this unique storytelling tool. I’ve been fortunate enough to play a small role collaborating with the CREATE Lab on EarthTime since 2018 from the World Economic Forum’s side and with my pending departure from the Forum, the ultimate aim of this work is to not only formally archive the information that is stuck in my head into a form that is more widely accessible and help future users of the tool avoid mistakes that I made during my EarthTime journey, but I also hope this document is able to convey the excitement and joy that I’ve been lucky enough to experience whilst a collaborator on this project. It is my hope that others can find the same excitement and joy in using data to help communities across the globe—either in Davos, Pittsburgh, or somewhere in between—examine major environmental, social, and political phenomenon across time, across space, and between each other.

## Premise {-}

Both the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and the World Economic Forum recognize that progress happens by bringing together people from all walks of life—ranging from government and business, to civil society and academia—who have the drive and the will to make positive change. As our world has become increasingly complex, people are increasingly seeking out ways to make sense of societal shifts at both a local and global level. While people try to make sense of new phenomenon by just using data, data alone struggles to capture and bear witness to the key issues of our time. The EarthTime project is an interface that attempts to create powerful narratives by connecting the dots, using facts, conveying a sense of empathy, and using data all at once. 

Using large spatial and temporal datasets, the fact-based narratives of created alongside experts within this project have successfully broken through language and culture barriers, forged common ground across diverse viewpoints, and to create the sense of unity needed to have meaningful discourse about how to best chart our future together more meaningfully.

The aim of this document is to introduce readers and guide readers as they begin to explore how best to create data narratives for the interactive, web-based version of EarthTime. In doing so, we recognize that some of these stories will be ones of decline, but hopefully as a tool it can be used to demonstrate our collective power to effect change.

## Documentation Structure {-}

1. This document opens with a brief history of the EarthTime project. This section starts with the history of the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University where EarthTime was first conceived and goes onto detail EarthTime’s journey from the original time-lapse project proposed as a collaboration between  Google’s Earth Engine team, Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab, and TIME Magazine all the way to its presence as the Global Situation Space at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meetings in Davos, Switzerland, as well as its continued use on the Forum’s Strategic Intelligence platform.

2. The next section of this document goes onto discuss the basics of EarthTime in what is referred to as the “Explore” view that one would find when visiting the [main EarthTime website](http://earthtime.org/explore). It also suggests a few prerequisites for computer hardware that one is expected to have to successful run EarthTime in a browser.

3. The third section of this documents focuses on generating ideas for EarthTime stories—and by extension generating ideas for the data layers that underpin them. This section is generally focused on communication with and outreach to three major groups: academic experts, industry leaders, and journalists.

4. While not technical in nature, per se, the fourth section of the document explores the philosophy around data gathering process with a special emphasis placed on open-source data web scraping. It is predicated on the assumption that one of the three aforementioned groups has pointed you towards a data that is either messy or otherwise doesn’t exist in a computer-readable format. It briefly touches on data analysis, but that subject is beyond the scope of this document.

5. The fifth section of the document provides a few lines on the art of data wrangling. It implores readers to data wrangle using a “code first; not click first” approach so that their process can be reproducible through code. Much of the data wrangling documentation for EarthTime can be found in the companion R package, ["EarthTimeR"](https://github.com/andrewcberkley/EarthTimeR).

6. The document’s sixth section looks at getting formatted data into EarthTime with a process known as “data ingestion”. This section covers the use of Google sheets to read data into EarthTime.

7. The document’s seventh section examines a number of philosophies around data visualization in the EarthTime specific context. It provides a brief introduction to the different types of data layers, color theory, as well as geopolitical considerations that should be taken into account when attempting to visualize names and borders in regions with disputed territories.

8. The eighth section covers the EarthTime layers sheets. It covers understanding the structure of waypoints, waypoint URLs, and CSV layers. Within the CSV layers section, the most fields are covered as well as special considerations that should be taken into account when determining how to best use certain fields.

9. Rather than an editing or style guide, the ninth section of the document tries to establish a reasonable workflow when attempting to publish an EarthTime story. It also dives into arguments for an against using EarthTime for conveying certain types of data to a wide variety of audiences and what one should take into account when pushing the limits of storytelling through EarthTime.

10. The tenth section covers dissemination of EarthTime stories. It looks at the advantages of visualizing stories with mobile users in mind, how to embed stories in iFrames, and the use of GIFs (pronounced “/ɡɪf/”, not “/dʒɪf/”) for highlighting critical waypoints.

11. The final section covers closing thoughts and final remarks on the EarthTime project. It also includes the reference section for those wishing to explore more.

## Acknowledgements {-}

First and foremost, it has been a pleasure collaborating with Illah Nourbakhsh and the wider CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. Since our first contact, I’ve resonated with your vision to promote data literacy, inspire meaningful dialogue, and democratize access to data for everyone in an inclusive and transparent way. A very special thanks is reserved to those I worked most closely with on EarthTime, especially Paul Dille, Ryan Hoffman, Jared Kohler, Gabriel O'Donnell, Randy Sargent, and Anne Wright who helped create the platform that helps us look at in the mirror at the results of our past decisions in the hopes that as a society we can make more informed, forward-facing choices.

To everyone at the World Economic Forum who was instrumental in establishing and shepherding the relationship with the CREATE Lab at different points in time for various programming purposes at the Global Situation Space at Forum events especially Gill Cassar, Taylor Clayton, Teresa Hartmann, and Dara Lee.

My opportunities with EarthTime wouldn’t have been possible without the backing and support of the Forum’s Strategic Intelligence team (formerly Knowledge Networks & Analysis), especially Stephan Mergenthaler and Jim Landale, as well as the broader support of the team’s Managing Director at the time, Jeremy Jurgens, and of course and big thank you to the wider network of experts from the Forum’s Global Future Councils and Expert Network that I had the pleasure of working with over the years.

Finally, I’m eternally grateful to my main partner in crime, editor, and dear friend, John Letzing. Your love of words and storytelling as well as your keen eye for details allowed us to publish nearly 100 original EarthTime stories together. For better or for worse, we were determined to bear witness to some of the far-flung tragedies of the world using EarthTime and the data at our disposal and it is my hope that the couple million of people that consumed our stories will have the courage and imagination to use whatever tools they have at their disposal to deliver positive change. Please forgive me for any errors—grammatical or otherwise—present within this document. All errors in this document are my own and I’ve decided to leave the making of this document error-free as an exercise for the reader.
